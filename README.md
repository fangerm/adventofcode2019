# Advent Of Code 2019

My solutions for the AOC2019 (Still in progress - only started on 01.12.2020!). 

Most of these are implemented in Rust, with a few at the beginning in Python.
Modify `main.rs` to run the day you want to test.

Be warned that some of this code can be a bit messy; particularly
processing code besides the IntCode VM.
